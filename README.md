# TypeScript OOP & Generics Tasks

This project demonstrates various TypeScript concepts including type assertions, type guards, classes, inheritance, access modifiers, static and abstract classes, getters/setters, generics, and more. Each task is implemented and tested in [`index.ts`](index.ts).

## Project Structure

- [`index.html`](index.html): Loads the compiled JavaScript in the browser.
- [`index.ts`](index.ts): Contains all TypeScript code and solutions for the tasks.
- [`index.js`](index.js): Compiled JavaScript output from TypeScript.
- [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json): TypeScript configuration file.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Type Assertions & Type Guards**  
   Demonstrates the difference between type assertions and type guards.

2. **BankAccount Class**  
   Implements a class with private properties and public methods.

3. **Animal & Dog Classes**  
   Shows inheritance and method overriding with protected members.

4. **Person Class with Readonly Property**  
   Demonstrates the use of readonly properties.

5. **Refactored Person Class**  
   Uses parameter properties in the constructor.

6. **MathUtils Static Class**  
   Implements static properties and methods.

7. **Shape & Circle Classes**  
   Demonstrates abstract classes and method implementation.

8. **Temperature Class with Getter/Setter**  
   Shows encapsulation with validation in setters.

9. **Employee & Manager Classes**  
   Demonstrates inheritance, access modifiers, and method overriding.

10. **Generic Box Class**  
    Implements a generic class with type-safe methods.

11. **Generic Functions**  
    Shows generic functions with and without constraints.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.
2. Compile the TypeScript file:
   ```sh
   tsc
   ```
3. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in your browser to see the output in the console.
